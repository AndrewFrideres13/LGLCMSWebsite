## Plugin used: Color Picker by Vanderlee: https://github.com/vanderlee/colorpicker (Some modification by me for Ajax events)

Started as a school project back at CVTC using PHP with a website, revamped to be a dynamic game
library of sorts with (90's retro) customizable themeing (think early Steam), and the ability
to add, edit, and delete games from it. Mostly used to work with PHP, Jquery, & Ajax calls to 
become more familiar with them. Also an excuse to play with some security functions with PHP.
